## Test Execution Notes

**Important**: Tests must be run with `--test-threads=1` due to shared mock UEFI state:

```bash
cargo test --tests --features std -- --test-threads=1
```

This ensures tests run serially and don't interfere with each other's mock memory pool state.

## Test Coverage

The test suite validates:

### Type System
- ✅ Struct sizes match UEFI spec exactly
- ✅ Alignment requirements for DMA
- ✅ ABI compatibility (repr(C), calling conventions)
- ✅ Type safety (Copy, Clone, Debug traits)

### Memory Management
- ✅ Allocation and deallocation
- ✅ Alignment guarantees
- ✅ Out-of-memory handling
- ✅ Double-free detection
- ✅ Stress testing (100+ allocations)

### UEFI Services
- ✅ Boot Services API surface
- ✅ Runtime Services structures
- ✅ Status code handling
- ✅ Error propagation
- ✅ Safe wrapper abstractions

### Invariants
- ✅ GUID equality properties
- ✅ Memory type ordering
- ✅ TPL level ordering
- ✅ Memory attribute bit independence
- ✅ Error bit consistency
